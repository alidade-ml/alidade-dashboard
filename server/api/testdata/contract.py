"""Astrolabe contract between engine and callback.

Source of truth: this file in the engine repo. Vendored verbatim into
``astrolabe-callbacks`` (and any third-party callback library) via
``tools/vendor-contract.py``.

This file holds the **names** (env vars, Aim tag keys, metric
namespaces, default values) AND the **canonical formatters/parsers**
for any value with a non-trivial encoding. Both sides of the contract
go through the same helpers so the wire format can't drift across the
engine/callback split.

Behavioral expectations live in ``docs/callback-contract.md``.

Rules enforced by CI:

- Stdlib-only imports. Adding any third-party import is a contract
  violation; ``tools/check-contract-stdlib-only.py`` blocks merge.
- Modifying this file requires bumping ``CONTRACT_VERSION``;
  ``tools/check-contract-bump.py`` blocks merge.
- Every ``ALIDADE_*``/``AIM_*`` env var the engine sets and every
  ``astrolabe.*`` Aim tag the engine reads must appear as a constant
  here; ``tests/test_contract_completeness.py`` enforces.
- Bare contract-literal strings outside this file are a violation;
  the engine must route through ``contract.ENV_*``/``contract.TAG_*``
  + the format/parse helpers (no inline ``json.dumps`` of contract
  values, no inline ``"astrolabe.user"`` keys).

# Bump pattern:
#   MAJOR — breaking change (rename or remove an env var / tag, change
#           the wire format of a value)
#   MINOR — backward-compatible addition (new optional env var / tag,
#           new helper)
#   PATCH — doc-only / comment-only edit
#
# A callback library's vendored copy carries the engine version it was

# --- Env vars: ENGINE sets in the training process -------------------------
#
# The engine writes these into the training process's environment before
# the training command runs. A contract-compliant callback reads them
# (directly or via helpers) to wire itself to the orchestration.

# Unique identifier for one submit (one `astrolabe submit` invocation).
# The Aim run carries it as ``astrolabe.submit_id``, which arrives through
# AIM_RUN_TAGS rather than from this variable; the callback reads this one
# directly only for checkpoint provenance.
ENV_SUBMIT_ID = "ALIDADE_SUBMIT_ID"

# Human-readable experiment name from the YAML. The callback resolves it
# as the Aim *experiment*, taking precedence over any experiment_name
# passed at the call site. Not the run name, which is a separate field.
ENV_EXPERIMENT_NAME = "ALIDADE_EXPERIMENT_NAME"

# Tag dict the engine wants applied to every run produced under this
# submit. Wire format: ``key1=val1,key2=val2`` (NOT JSON — keys and
# values are pasted directly into the env var, comma-separated). Use
# :func:`format_aim_run_tags` and :func:`parse_aim_run_tags` to read
# and write this — never inline the encoding.

# Filesystem path to the local Aim repo the callback should write
# through. Set unless the NUC selected the tunnel transport with
# ``aim_local_mode: false``, in which case callbacks fall back to the

# Engine constructs the value via :func:`format_local_aim_repo_path`.
ENV_AIM_REPO_PATH = "ALIDADE_AIM_REPO_PATH"

# Path to a jsonl file the callback appends structured events to: buffer
# heartbeats, sample submissions, run close, drain failures, schema

# evidence one existed. There is no run-open record.

# it. No callback reads this.

#
# Declared here because it has two consumers that must agree exactly: the
# callback builds these names, and the NUC-side exporter reads them back.
# A disagreement is silent — the reader finds no sequence and
# reports a batch with no samples, which is a plausible and wrong answer.

# --- Canonical formatters / parsers ---------------------------------------
#
# Both engine and callback go through these. The wire format lives in
# exactly one place, so a change to the encoding requires editing this
# file — which triggers the CONTRACT_VERSION-bump CI guard.
#
# Why these specifically: only values with non-trivial encodings need a
# helper. A constant like ``ENV_SUBMIT_ID`` is just a name; the value
# is just a string passed through, no encoding involved. ``AIM_RUN_TAGS``
# encodes a dict into a single string, and ``ALIDADE_AIM_REPO_PATH``
# templates a submit_id into a path — both are encodings, both need
# canonical helpers.
